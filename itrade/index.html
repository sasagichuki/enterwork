                   <p>
                        Over 18 million Kenyans out of the total population of 40 million live in desolation. The Red Cross Society of Kenya is one of the dedicated organisations, who throughout the years, have played their part in elevating the quality of life of the Kenyan people.

                    <h3>The Problem</h3>
                    <p>
                      Over the past 50 years, the Red Cross Society of Kenya has positively impacted millions of lives. From tackling natural disasters, poverty, poor health & malnutrition to providing clean water &amp; education. In order to continue its good work, they needed a steady stream of donations.

                    <h3>The Insight </h3>
                    <p>
                       People are passionate about specific causes and charities, but tend to feel powerless in the face of the suffering of others. Little do they know, that their simple sacrifices can have life changing consequences for those in need. We wanted to create a link between these seemingly trivial spends and the value they have on the less fortunate's lives. 
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="column">
                    <h3>Our Idea</h3>
                    <p>
                       We leveraged people's spending habits by pitting the value of the "luxury items" they buy against the needs of the less fortunate. To make the process engaging and fun, we gamified it by creating a virtual shop where people could virtually trade in their ‘luxury wants’ and see the cash equivalent go towards their preferred cause.

                              Perceptions towards charitable donating changed, with many realizing just how much of a difference even the smallest donation could make on another’s life. 
<br><br>
People got to “own” charitable causes making them even more passionate towards donating.
<br><br>
By tracking their donations people found the process more transparent and were therefore reassured and encouraged.
