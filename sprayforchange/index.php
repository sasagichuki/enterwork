                   <p>
                        As we turned towards a new chapter in Kenya’s history, we needed a beacon that would unify us and remind us that Kenya is a great country, with an even greater people. Basco Paints took to the reigns and gave the country a platform for self-expression, where artists could reflect the country's optimistic mood and share their vision of a new Kenya at an iconic landmark.

                    <h3>The Problem</h3>
                    <p>
                        Being in an industry that’s perceived as dull and mundane by many, Basco Paints was in dire need of a make-over. They wanted to inject some excitement and colour into the minds of people when they thought of paint and their brand, but they didn't know how. 
                    </p>

                <div class="column">
                    <h3>The Insight </h3>
                    <p>
                      Kenya was on the eve of a paradigm shift and was due to undertake a unique general election that would change political, administrative and development structures. In anticipation, there was an atmosphere of optimism, hope for growth &amp; development, enhanced self-expression and calls for peace and unity.

                <div class="column">
                    <h3>Our Idea</h3>
                    <p>
                       We gave 10 amazing graffiti artists the chance to transform a unique 100 metre 'canvas', at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA), into an enviable work of art, rich in messages of peace, unity and their expression of a new Kenya. That one small change morphed into a movement, and artists begun to express different perspectives of positive change on diverse ‘canvases’.

The Jomo Kenyatta International Airport was the perfect canvas to showcase a new Kenya to Kenyans of all walks of life, as well as international visitors. We captured the project as it unfolded and shared the vision of the 10 graffiti artists with the world.

                                  Our talented artisans got another unique canvas to paint, the walls of the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), during the Global South-South Conference. UNEP selected ‘Spray for Change’ for our thought-provoking and innovative visual medium, to spearhead their eco-project that’s working towards a lead-free environment. Being the first local company to make the move towards Lead and Chrome free paints for our decorative range, our artists were best placed to pioneer the need for an eco-change.
