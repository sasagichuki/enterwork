                   <h1>RED RALLY: THE RACE TO ROAD SAFETY </h1>
                   <p>
                       With 3,800 tragic road accidents in 2012 and 1,823 in 2013, the Kenya Red Cross was tired of all the senseless injuries and fatalities that were taking place, that could be avoided. With the festive season round the corner, they knew they had to step in and they did, with an exciting gamified campaign that used popular social media tools to show how even the fastest drivers play it safe on the roads.       
                   </p>

                    <h3>The Problem</h3>
                    <p>
                        Every year thousands of Kenyans lose their lives as a result of road carnage. This is especially so during the festive season when people travel to see their loved ones. <br><br> Over the years, research has shown that most lives are lost due to reckless driving. The Kenya Red Cross Society decided something needed to be done to educate people on the importance of road safety, especially safe driving.

                        We got fans behind the wheel of two of the fastest rally drivers.
